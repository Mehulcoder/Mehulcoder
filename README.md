# Hi there, I'm Mehul :wave:

## Your friendly neighborhood Software Developer

With a background in tech from IIT Guwahati and crafting code at Amazon as an SDE II, I'm all about making an impact through technology. I blend my love for algorithms and system design with a zest for life-long learning and fitness.

### What keeps me buzzing:

- :hammer_and_wrench: Improving and scaling software at Amazon, where complexity meets creativity.
- :mortar_board: An endless curiosity about cognitive science, learning methodologies, and productivity.
- :man-lifting-weights: Beyond the screen, I'm dedicated to fitness, nutrition, and decoding the science behind it.
- :coffee: A cup of coffee is my elixir for focus and a partner in coding marathons.
- :camera_with_flash: Through the lens, I bring out the world's hidden rhythms, enhanced by my expertise in Adobe Lightroom.
- :blue_book: A voracious reader, I immerse myself in the rules of art, philosophy, and the digital universe.
